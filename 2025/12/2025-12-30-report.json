      "analyse": "The cyber threat landscape at the end of 2025 is characterized by a sophisticated and diverse array of attacks, with a notable increase in the use of advanced techniques and targeting of critical sectors. State-sponsored APT groups, particularly those linked to China, are evolving their TTPs, incorporating kernel-mode rootkits and DNS poisoning for stealthy cyberespionage campaigns. Ransomware remains a pervasive threat, impacting critical infrastructure like energy providers and disrupting major services, often leveraging compromised credentials and publicly exposed services. The supply chain continues to be a significant vulnerability, as evidenced by data breaches originating from third-party vendors and customer service outsourcing firms, affecting large organizations and their clients. A key emerging trend is the exploitation of AI systems, with OWASP highlighting vulnerabilities in autonomous AI agents, including goal hijacking and malicious MCP servers, indicating a new frontier for attackers to weaponize AI hallucinations and leverage AI in sophisticated phishing infrastructures. Actively exploited vulnerabilities, such as MongoBleed in MongoDB, demonstrate the immediate danger posed by unpatched systems, allowing unauthenticated data exfiltration. Authentication bypass flaws and remote code execution vulnerabilities in widely used software and plugins present critical risks, with zero-day exploits being observed. The growing volume of new CVEs underscores the constant need for robust vulnerability management and proactive defense strategies. The overall state of threats points to a need for organizations to not only focus on traditional security controls but also to rapidly adapt to AI-specific risks, enhance supply chain security, and maintain rigorous patching and incident response capabilities to counter increasingly stealthy and financially motivated adversaries.",

Les groupes APT parrainés par des États, en particulier ceux liés à la Chine, font évoluer leurs TTP, intégrant des rootkits en mode noyau et l'empoisonnement DNS pour des campagnes de cyberespionnage furtives. Le ransomware reste une menace omniprésente, impactant les infrastructures critiques comme les fournisseurs d'énergie et perturbant les services majeurs, souvent en exploitant des identifiants compromis et des services exposés publiquement. La chaîne d'approvisionnement continue d'être une vulnérabilité significative, comme en témoignent les violations de données provenant de fournisseurs tiers et de sociétés d'externalisation de services clients, affectant de grandes organisations et leurs clients. Une tendance émergente clé est l'exploitation des systèmes d'IA, l'OWASP soulignant les vulnérabilités des agents IA autonomes, y compris le détournement d'objectifs et les serveurs MCP malveillants, indiquant une nouvelle frontière pour les attaquants afin d'armer les hallucinations de l'IA et de tirer parti de l'IA dans des infrastructures de phishing sophistiquées. Les vulnérabilités activement exploitées, telles que MongoBleed dans MongoDB, démontrent le danger immédiat posé par les systèmes non patchés, permettant l'exfiltration de données non authentifiée. Les failles de contournement d'authentification et les vulnérabilités d'exécution de code à distance dans les logiciels et plugins largement utilisés présentent des risques critiques, avec l'observation d'exploits zero-day.

L'infection initiale repose sur de fausses mises à jour logicielles, redirigeant les requêtes de mise à jour vers des serveurs contrôlés par l'attaquant. Le groupe utilise des attaques de type 'adversaire au milieu', des chargeurs multi-étapes furtifs, des composants de malware chiffrés, le 'DLL sideloading' dans des processus légitimes et la dissimulation d'appels API. Des victimes ont été identifiées en Turquie, en Chine et en Inde, avec certains systèmes compromis pendant plus d'un an.",
