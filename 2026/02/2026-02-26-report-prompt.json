## Chat Control is in the final stretch – but it could be a marathon, not a sprint
In late 2025, Denmark reversed course on the controversial CSA Regulation, proposing to eliminate mandatory scanning of private messages and add protections for encrypted communications, after seven EU countries failed to reach an agreement. The Council's position, while not perfect, avoids provisions that would force services like Signal or WhatsApp to scan user messages or undermine encryption, aligning with the European Parliament’s 2023 position. However, disagreements remain regarding a "voluntary" scanning scheme and the potential for mandatory age verification, which could require users to provide sensitive data for accessing online communications. The final negotiations are scheduled for June 2026, but face delays and ongoing influence from the European Commission.

## The CLAIR Model: A Synthesized Conceptual Framework for Mapping Critical Infrastructure Interdependencies &#x5b;Guest Diary&#x5d;, (Wed, Feb 25th)
The CLAIR Model is a new conceptual framework designed to address the analytical gap created by the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). It synthesizes the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) with the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture to provide a structured scope for identifying and visualizing critical infrastructure interdependencies. The model expands the traditional five-level Purdue hierarchy into a ten-level architectural stack, incorporating dependencies on primary utility infrastructure and cloud systems. A key aspect of the CLAIR Model is its ability to categorize dependencies and visualize them using Sankey Flow Maps, enabling organizations to understand and mitigate cascading failures, such as those resulting from power grid disruptions impacting data centers.

## Hidden in Plain Sight: How Attackers Weaponize Alternate Data Streams to Hide Malware
Windows' NTFS file system allows for hidden data streams attached to files, known as Alternate Data Streams (ADS). Attackers exploit this feature to conceal malware, including ransomware payloads, by embedding malicious code within seemingly harmless files, evading security tools. Attackers utilize legitimate Windows tools like rundll32.exe, wscript, and certutil to execute payloads directly from these hidden ADS streams, a technique documented under MITRE ATT&CK ID T1564.004. Detection methods involve using Windows commands like dir /r and Get-Item, forensic tools like Streams.exe, and security tools providing command-line visibility to identify unusual ADS activity.

## Detection Without Remediation is Just Surveillance Theater
The external threat intelligence market has historically focused on scanning the dark web, identifying threats, and alerting customers, but this approach has not prevented breaches. The proliferation of low-cost infostealer malware has accelerated the time between credential theft and network compromise, creating a "remediation velocity gap." Flare is developing a Threat Exposure Management (TEM) technology stack that automatically remediates compromised credentials by integrating with identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID, resetting passwords within seconds and eliminating human intervention. This approach is gaining traction with Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) who are seeking remediation infrastructure to embed into their service delivery.

## Exposing the Undercurrent: Disrupting the GRIDTIDE Global Cyber Espionage Campaign
Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), Mandiant, and partners disrupted a global espionage campaign targeting telecommunications and government organizations across four continents. The suspected PRC-nexus cyber espionage group, UNC2814, has been tracked since 2017 and impacted 53 victims in 42 countries. The group used API calls to Google Sheets as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, disguising malicious traffic as legitimate activity. Actions taken included terminating Google Cloud Projects, disabling attacker infrastructure and accounts, releasing indicators of compromise (IOCs), and discovering a novel backdoor called GRIDTIDE. GRIDTIDE leverages Google Sheets for C2 communication and exfiltrates data, including personally identifiable information (PII), from compromised systems.

## The million-dollar front door and the tailgater: Why strong auth could fail at SaaS session integrity
Attackers are bypassing strong authentication measures by exploiting vulnerabilities in session integrity after the initial login. Security professionals have focused on securing the login event with measures like FIDO2 and device trust, but have neglected to secure the subsequent single sign-on (SSO) sessions. The handoff of authentication to applications creates a vulnerability where stolen session cookies can be used to access resources, bypassing all previous security controls. Mitigations include deploying token binding, shortening session timeouts, implementing IP pinning, monitoring session anomalies, and adopting continuous access evaluation.

## Untrusted repositories turn Claude code into an attack vector
Flaws in Anthropic’s Claude Code AI coding assistant could allow remote code execution and API key theft when users open untrusted repositories. Check Point Research found vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59536 and CVE-2026-21852, that abuse features like Hooks and environment variables to execute shell commands and exfiltrate API credentials. Opening a crafted repository could trigger hidden commands, bypass consent safeguards, and potentially expose shared enterprise cloud environments, while compromised API keys could allow attackers to access and modify shared data. Anthropic addressed the issues by tightening trust prompts and restricting API calls.

## Iran : la bombe hydrique
Iran faces a severe water scarcity crisis, with over 70% of its main aquifers being overexploited, leading to collapsing water tables and reduced renewable water resources. This situation, exacerbated by policies encouraging water-intensive agriculture and subsidized water and energy, is fueling social unrest, rural migration, and food price inflation. The water crisis poses a significant threat to Iran's stability, exceeding the risks associated with nuclear ambitions or military conflict, and is a key factor in shaping the country's internal dynamics and external posture.

## Middle Powers Must Win the AI Deployment Race
Middle powers like the UK and Canada should focus on deploying AI rather than developing ever larger AI models. They should collaborate to win the deployment race, embedding AI across economies and militaries to solve specific problems. A UK-Canada Partnership on AI Deployment is proposed, structured around five pillars to accelerate adoption and safeguard sovereignty. The partnership would involve shared procurement, collaborative testing, talent circulation, and joint operational testbeds.

## Russia, Navalny and the Uses of Poison in State-Sponsored Assassinations
Aleksey Navalny's death in a Russian prison was determined by European laboratories to be caused by poisoning with the toxin Epibatidine. The European governments condemned Russia's breach of international law and disregard for the Chemical Weapons Convention, calling for action. Throughout history, elites and those challenging authority have used poison, with states employing it in assassinations since at least 1945, including democracies. Russia and its allies have a long history of using poison against dissidents and foreign leaders, and while methods of delivery and detection evolve, the practice is likely to continue.
